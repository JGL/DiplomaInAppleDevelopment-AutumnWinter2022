  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Before we continue with Develop in Swift Explorations, I want to go through <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2022#assessment">the assessments that you'll be completing at the end of this Unit</a>. Both are similar to the ones you did for Unit 1 - a multiple choice test on your knowledge of Swift and a programming exam where you'll make an iOS application. Let's take a look at last years mock and real exams. Any questions?</div>
  <div>Now let's turn to page 135 of the Student Guide and review the BoogieBot Playground together.</div>
  <div>Now let's turn to page 136 of the Student Guide and complete the Data Visualisation Playground together.</div>
  <div>Now let's turn to page 138 of the Student Guide and complete the "Build a QuestionBot App" together.</div>
  <div>Now let's go through the Apply and Extend section of the Teacher Guide on page 239 of the Teacher Guide.</div>
  <div>Now let's go through Section 2.4 "Design an Experience" of the Student Guide from page 152.</div>
  <div>If we have time, let's complete "Episode 2 - The Viewing Party" on page 164 of your Student Guide, or the remainder for homework/the workshop with Ken later in the week.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
