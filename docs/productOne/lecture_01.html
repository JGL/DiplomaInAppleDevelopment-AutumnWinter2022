  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>We are going to do the exercises and challenges that I set in groups of three - with one PC user in each to start with - so please message me on Slack right now if you are a PC user. If you are living together, please message too, so I can put you in a group with your house mate.</div>
  <div>I'm going to be using Apple's <a href="https://books.apple.com/gb/book/develop-in-swift-explorations/id1581182728">Develop in Swift Explorations (Xcode 13)</a> as the main text for this Unit - so if you are on a Mac please download it via the Apple Book store. I'm curious if that works on PC too? I didn't have one to test with I'm afraid. For those of you with PC's don't worry, Tom Lynch will be setting up remote access ASAP. Please remind me next session to update you on the remote access status PC users!</div>
  <div>This is the second time I'm teaching this syllabus, so I want to hear all your feedback - good and bad!</div>
  <div>Before we start with Swift Explorations I wanted to share some Swift resources:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html">Swift.org's "Swift Tour"</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/">Swift.org's getting started guide</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language-swift-5-3/id881256329">Apple's Swift reference: The Swift Programming Language Book</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/">Xcode support from Apple</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/">Videos from Apple's annual WorldWide Developer's Conference (WWDC or dubdubs)</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/topics/awesome?l=swift">Awesome guides to Swift on Github</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Official Swift Playgrounds App for iPadOS and macOS</a> - really useful interactive app for learning Swift. Caution! Swift Playgrounds Uses the latest SwiftUI code to make interfaces, something that isn't covered in Swift Explorations, which is the text book we'll be using for this course. It's the future, but it isn't what you are going to be examined on.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Hi-Rez/Satin">An interesting open source framework for creative code, written in Swift</a>. I had a chance to use this on a freelance project last year: <a href="https://christienmeindertsma.com/Sharing-Elements">Sharing Elements by Christien Meinderstma</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Now let's go through the readme and wiki for this unit: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2022">https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2022</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Let's start by going through the introduction section of Swift Explorations - paying particular attention to how the units are broken up into four sections (Get Started, Play, Build and Design), with Episodes between units. Also making sure to download the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/explorations/xcode13/student.zip">student materials that accompany the book</a>.</div>
  <div>Now let's begin, with "Get Started with Values" - and I'll take you through some extra exercises as we start looking at the exercises in your student guide.</div>
  <div>Let's start with the "What Is Programming?" section and the Explore This exercise - "Consider your favourite app on your phone" exercise.</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Computers in Disguise".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Values" section and the Explore This exercise - "Take a photo of an everyday object".</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Using Data to Solve Problems".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Naming and Identifiers" section and the Explore This exercise - "Compare these two notes".</div>
  <div>Next a 10 minute 3 person group session - "Naming to Organise Values".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Strings" section and the Explore This exercise - "Imagine you’re tasked with creating chatbot responses to the user inputs below."</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Concatenating Strings".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Constants and Variables" section and the Explore This exercise - "Imagine your life is a program".</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Ceteris Paribus".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Simulation" section and the Explore This exercise - "Imagine you work as a car safety engineer".</div>
