  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to the Creative Computing Institute!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to the Diploma in Apple Development 🍎👩🏻‍💻!
  </div>
  <div>This is a brand new course, so I'd love to hear all your feedback - please please please <a href="https://instagram.com/jgl">DM me on Instagram with your thoughts</a>, or <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/">email me, via my website</a>, or just message me on the CCI Slack. I'm particularly looking out for good YouTube channels, so please share those if you find them.</div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, we'll have learnt about:
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction to the course via the github homepage and the wiki</li>
      <li>start making the homepage / intro lecture - make sure expectation to be in person every day, checking slack every day, working it, you are going to make one team app and one solo app and have them on the app store</li>
      <li>making every tutorial - x5 every monday morning from 1030-1300 - do they want to rotate?</li>
      <li>Usual intro in terms of things to keep in mind</li>
      <li>Also look at swift unit 4 lecture that is in product one to ensure no crossover</li>
      <li>Also do the thoughts for the future ceri hand one? </li>
      <li>Product One - team brief is care - sharing information? In team, based around swift explorations.</li>
      <li>Product Two - solo brief is play - making movement? Solo all the way, researching the swift you need with me along the way. Like a real app, for example: </li>
      <li>haptics moment?
        https://www.andy.works/words/the-most-satisfying-checkbox</li>
      <li>Train to recognise flowers and make app
        https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/training_a_create_ml_model_to_classify_flowers</li>
      <li>https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/tracking_the_user_s_face_in_real_time
      </li>
      <li>aim is to have final show in the Apple store covent garden or regent street</li>
      <li>Sign up to github and message me your ID's on Slack</li>
      <li>Brain expanding resources.</li>
      <li>See you on Friday, ML One will start mid block once code knowledge is there.</li>
    </ul>

    Introduction to the Intensive.
  </div>
  <div>The homepage for the Intensive is: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/IntroductionToCreativeComputing2022/">https://jgl.github.io/IntroductionToCreativeComputing2022/</a>. Please refer to it for all the slides for all the sessions.
  </div>
  <div>
    For the next five days <a href="index.html">we'll be doing 10 sessions</a>. This is the first session. Two sessions a day - 1000-1300 and 1400-1700. Each session is made up of three parts:
    <ol>
      <li>A 60 minute lecture</li>
      <li>A 90 minute workshop</li>
      <li>A 30 minute discussion</li>
    </ol>
    The lectures will be recorded but the workshops and the discussions won't.

  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">Creative Computing Institute (CCI)</a>?</div>
  <div>What you are going to learn in this Intensive.</div>
  <div>We are going to learn about Creative Computing - a blend of Computational Thinking and Creative Coding.</div>
  <div>What is Computational Thinking?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>To learn how see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
      <li>Most of all, to <b>learn</b> how to be <b>autodidacts</b>.</li>
      <li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Look it up! What did you find?</div>
  <div>What is Creative Coding?</div>
  <div>I believe all coding is creative, as all life is creative. Specifically, creative coding is about blending creative techniques with software engineering. I want you to learn how to write code but also how you could use computing to change your practice. You can make lots of earth credits writing software, but I'm much more interested in giving you the tools to change yourself, your practice and the world.</div>
  <div>Next, a really important diagram.</div>
  <div>
    <img src="images/JimCampbellFormula_for_computer_art.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/">Jim Campbell</a>'s formula for Computer Art. Realise that you can use things without understanding every aspect of them. All that computers do is process inputs into outputs. That's it.</div>
  </div>
  <div>But what are we going to learn?</div>
  <div>
    <div>We are going to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which is <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies">the most commonly used programming language in the world</a>.</div>
  </div>
  <div>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    We are going to learn JavaScript using a library called <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. A library is just a collection of code. <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> was specifically designed as a great way for designers, artists and others to learn to code. It was originally created by <a href="http://www.lauren-mccarthy.com/">Lauren McCarthy</a> but now has <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/#contributors">many contributors</a>. p5.js emerged out of another project: <a href="https://www.processing.org/overview/">Processing</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch the (interactive) presentation about p5.js at <a href="http://hello.p5js.org">hello.p5js.org</a>.</div>
  <div>Other coding resources and teachers of Creative Coding</div>
  <div>
    Some useful general JavaScript coding resources:

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Some useful p5.js coding resources:
    <ul>
      <li>A good place to start your p5.js learning journey is the <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">Get Started</a> tutorial. The <a href="https://p5js.org/learn/">learn section</a> has a series of tutorials. The <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">examples section</a> is full of real examples to copy from - that's how I usually start a new project - by duplicating an existing project. When I'm writing p5.js, I <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">always have the reference open</a> so that I can refer to it constantly. Finally, <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10">p5.js forum</a> is a great place to ask questions and find other learners. I <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/u/jgl">use it all the time</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/">The Coding Train</a> both by <a href="https://shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a>. <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> is completely free if you put the price to $0. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/">The Coding Train</a> is a brilliant YouTube channel that has amazing creative coding content. I'd really, <i>really</i>, <b>really</b> recommend Daniel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA">Code! Programming with p5.js</a> playlist.</li>
